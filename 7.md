# Failiure of All Protests: Maharashtra Elections of 2024

Election results often bring surprises, and the recent Maharashtra elections were no different. Let’s start with some background before diving into the perplexing results.

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), a political alliance aligned with Congress ideologies, lost its lead to the BJP-led Mahayuti. This shift is largely credited to the BJP’s strong organization and a strategy. After the Lok Sabha elections, the MVA appeared complacent from June to October 2024, while Mahayuti actively prepared with a game plan. If one looks through the ’rosy tinted glasses’ the win of the MVA was an obvious one, but the actual results were quite stunning due to the sheer margin, hence an electoral tsunami.

We can't really deny the fact that operating of the Ladki Bahin made a huge difference especially in women's turnout % which went up by 1%. The Shinde's government wasn't just speaking about the transfer of 7500 inr per month in the account of 2.3cr women. It actually implicated this scheme for women empowerment. The double engine sarkar is a crucial facet for Mahayuti's win. But the question arises that what quantum of the aforesaid factor is attributed to the elections held.

Coming to the most speculated topic, EVM Conspiracy Theories. Can it be presumed that the blaming the EVMs is a loser's lament? Do we need a Forensic investigation merely based on the instinctive reaction? The settlement of the argument once and for all is the need of the hour.

After the BJP's loss in 2009’s Lok Sabha elections, BJP MP GVL Narasimha Rao penned down and titled Democracy at Risk! Can we trust our EVM? 15 years later this shoe is on the other side.

- The surge of voting turnout after evening isn't inexplicable. The Election Commission should have been more clear in giving polling results at every hour per constituency. That perhaps would have assuaged some of the fears.

- After the fact checking, claims of voting turnout and votes counted being different are false

- Did the replacement of EVMs took place by the government agents As a matter of fact there has been no evidence of video or audio of a strong room being broken into. -

- Hacking of the EVMs couldn't possibly take place. This defies logic as these are standalone machines.

Hence either the Election Commission flags off certain issues that needs to be answered, especially the distorting use of money power or the 100% verified audit paper trail system as suggested by an Indian news anchor, Mr. Rajdeep Sardesai in his personal blog.

Which method will the government have to adopt to silence all apprehensions?

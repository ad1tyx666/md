# The Detrimental Choice: Trump or Harris?

As the 2024 United States Presidential Elections approach, the political landscape is more charged thn ever. With Republican nominee, and Incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. This election presents a pivotal moment, not just for the United States, but for the entire world, as the policies and leadership styles of these two candidates will have far-reaching implications. The unfortunate reality is most people do not realise the Stakes of this Election. With pressing issues such as climate change, economic recovery, healthcare reform, and social justice at the forefront of public discourse, the decision made by American voters will resonate globally. The last few years have shown that United States policies can influence international relations, trade agreements, and global security.

Donald Trump returns to the political arena with a strong base that resonates with a significant portion of the electorate. His supporters appreciate his straightforward, often controversial style and his focus on America First policies. Trumpâ€™s platform emphasizes deregulation, tax cuts, and a robust national defense. He has consistently positioned himself as a champion of the working class, advocating for job creation and economic growth, particularly in manufacturing sectors, but sometimes with questionable means. However, Trump's presidency was marked by deep divisions and controversies, from his handling of immigration to his approach to foreign policy. His supporters value his decisive nature, while critics argue that his policies have often exacerbated social and racial tensions in the country. Can Donald J Trump even be trusted after the 2016-2020 Presidency?

On the other hand, Kamala Harris represents a more progressive vision. As Vice President, she has been at the forefront of key issues such as healthcare access, racial equality, and climate action. Her experience in the Senate and as Attorney General of California has shaped her approach to governance, emphasizing justice reform and community engagement. Harris's policies reflect a commitment to expanding healthcare, addressing climate change, and investing in education and infrastructure. She seeks to build coalitions across party lines to tackle systemic issues, though she faces the challenge of unifying a fractured Democratic Party. Regardless, there is no way her experience matches that of a former president, right?

The electorate is divided, with many voters feeling disenfranchised or disillusioned by the political system. Polls indicate that a significant number of Americans are frustrated with the choices presented to them. The polarization of the political landscape has made it difficult for candidates to appeal across party lines, leading to a highly charged and often contentious campaign environment. The unpredictability of the election mirrors past close races, such as Bush v. Gore in 2000, where every vote mattered. This time, voter turnout and engagement will be crucial, as both candidates work to energize their bases while attempting to sway undecided voters.

Each candidate brings distinct perspectives and policies, making this election a critical moment in American history. Ultimately, the power to decide lies with the citizens of the United States. Their choice will determine not only the future of the nation but also the global landscape in which we all reside. Therefore, we at Jaagrukta term this decision as, The Detrimental Choice: Trump or Harris?
